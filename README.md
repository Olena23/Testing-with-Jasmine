#Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Feedreader

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

## What was done?

I used Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.
They test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.
These tests include asynchronous tests. 

## How to run this project?
